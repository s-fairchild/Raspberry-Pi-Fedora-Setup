# Enable UART
# Only enable UART if you're going to use it as it has speed implications
# Serial console is ttyS0 on RPi3 and ttyAMA0 on all other variants
# u-boot will auto detect serial and pass corrent options to kernel if enabled

# We need this to be 32Mb to support VCHI services and drivers which use them
# but this isn't used by mainline VC4 driver so reduce to lowest supported value

# HAT and DT overlays. Documentation at Raspberry Pi here:
# https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/device-tree.md
# Each dtoverlay line is an individual HAT/overlay, multiple lines allowed

# Other options you can adjust for all Raspberry Pi Revisions

# All options documented at http://elinux.org/RPiconfig
# for more options see http://elinux.org/RPi_config.txt

# To use this on Fedora you need to use firmware provided device tree, not kernel
# For this functionality follow the following guide:
